# choose_word_game_HTML_CSS_JS

Hellow there,

Just another small game using HTML, CSS and JS

In this game player has to select 4 word from each column and create a word.
if the word is valid then those tiles will be destroyed 
and if not a valid word then selected tiled will be moved to top of the stack.
only bottom 3 rows tiles are selectble.

Aim of the game is to find all the four word present in the stack.

good luck ;)
